# Deep Learning & Computer Vision for Classification of Toxic Plant Species

This repository was originally created based on a research report for Dr. Hill Zhu's Deep Learning graduate class at Florida Atlantic University. 

Python scripts have been added to handle preprocessing of image data and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms using TensorFlow. At this time, the scripts only support binary image classification of plants as "toxic" (1) or "nontoxic" (0). The dataset is included in the .gitignore file as it is exceptionally large with 10,000 images nested in subdirectories.
